This is a project for estimating electricty bill savings if they change their windows:
Just a quick summary:



Capstone project ideas

Home energy efficiency calculator (global?)

Existing homeowners:
 
Estimate the energy efficiency improvement by switching to better windows / adding insulation / etc.

New home builders:
 
Estimate the energy efficiency improvement with design and material changes

Data needed:
 
[Window efficiency by type, size, and age]
National Weather: (https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api)
Average window size for different types of homes (Not found yet)
EIA
